* Chess Engine in Rust

** ( )TODO:
   - (x) move gen
   - ( ) add move generators per given square
***  ( ) implement basic evaulation
****  ( ) Material Evaluation:
      expand evaluate material to consider the diff btw White and Black material
****  ( ) Piece-Squre Tables
*****  ( ) impl piece-square tables for each piece
*****  ( ) adjust scores based on piece's position and game state
*** ( ) enhance evaluation
**** ( ) add positional evaluation
     impl `evaluate_piece_postion()` incorporate piece-square tables
**** ( ) additional evaluation factors
     - *mobility* : count no. of legal moves for each side and factor it
     - *king safety*: eval safety of kings (ex: pawn shields, open files near kings)
     - *pawn structure*: account for isolated pawns, doubled pawns, passed pawns and pawn chains
**** ( ) combine evaluation
     combine all the above strategies

*** ( ) search algorithm
    recursively evaluate moves at different depths
**** ( ) impl `minimax` search algo
**** ( ) impl `alpha-beta` search algo
*** ( ) improve search efficiency
**** ( ) move ordering
     order moves (ex: prioritize captures) to improve alpha-beta pruning
**** ( ) transposition table
     store and retrieve previously evaluated positions
*** ( ) advanced eval and optimization
    - ( ) impl `Quiescence Search`
          for positions with tactical possibilities, continue the search to avoid horizon effect
    - ( ) impl `Null Move pruning`: skip a turn to prune unlikely good moves in the search tree
    - ( ) late move reduction: reduce search depth for less likely moves
    - ( ) history heuristic: track and prioritize moves that have worked historically
*** ( ) move generation improvements:
    - ( ) *refactor move generation*: ensure accurate and efficient move generation.
    - ( ) *special move rules*: implement castling, en passant, and pawn promotion correctly.
*** ( ) code optimization:
    - ( ) *bitboard operations*: improve performance of bitboard operations (e.g., bit scanning, pop least significant bit).
    - ( ) *board copy performance*: optimize the copying of the board state for move evaluation.
    - ( ) *position caching*: add transposition table for position caching to avoid redundant calculations.

*** ( ) testing & debugging:
    - ( ) *test evaluation*: regularly test the evaluation function with known positions and ensure it behaves as expected.
    - ( ) *unit tests*: write tests for move generation, evaluation, and search algorithm to ensure correctness.
