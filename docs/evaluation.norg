* Evaluation
  This will tell us how good a potential move is.

** Material Evaluation
   4 rules. Also called piece-value
   ~ Avoid expaching one minor piece for 3 pawns
   ~ Encourage engine to have the bishop pair
   ~ Avoid exchanging 2 minor pieces for a rook and a pawn
   ~ Stick to human chess experience

   Final Equations (should be used to satisfy piece values):
   @math
   B > N > 3P
   B + N = R + 1.5P
   Q + P = 2R
   @end
** Position Evaluation
   3 rules. Also called PST (Piece Square table)
   ~ Bonuses for good squares
   ~ Penalties for bad squares
   ~ Neutral Value of 0 for other squares

   > Currenlty, PST and piece-value remain seperated, just so we can fine tune
     engine
** King's Safety Evaluation
   4 rules. Focuses on vulnerability and protection of the king
   ~ Bonuses for castling rights (especially on both sides)
   ~ Penalties for broken pawn shield around the king
   ~ Penalties for opponent pawn storms approaching the king
   ~ Penalties on King Tropism

   Final Equations:
   @math
   king_safety = a * castling_bonus
   - b * broken_shield
   - c * pawn_storm
   - d * tropism
   @end

** Mobility Evaluation
   3 rules. Emphasizes activity and freedom
   ~ More choices (/legal_moves/), more bonuses
   ~ Penalize cramped positions with low piece mobility
   ~ Weight mobility score based on piece type

   Final Equations:
   @math
   mobility = \sum{piece} (legal\_moves(piece) Ã— weight(piece))
   @end
