* Evaluation
  This will tell us how good a potential move is.

** Material Evaluation
   4 rules of thumb. Also called piece-value
   ~ Avoid expaching one minor piece for 3 pawns
   ~ Encourage engine to have the bishop pair
   ~ Avoid exchanging 2 minor pieces for a rook and a pawn
   ~ Stick to human chess experience

   Final Equations:
   @math
   B > N > 3P
   B + N = R + 1.5P
   Q + P = 2R
   @end
** Position Evaluation
   3 rules. Also called PST (Piece Square table)
   ~ Bonuses for good squares
   ~ Penalties for bad squares
   ~ Neutral Value of 0 for other squares

   > Currenlty, PST and piece-value remain seperated, just so we can fine tune
